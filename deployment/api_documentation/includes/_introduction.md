# Introduction

[Cape](https://alpha.thecape.ai) from [Bloomsbury AI](http://bloomsbury.ai) provides an API that makes it easy to build software that answers questions about the contents of documents.
For example, you can use Cape to:

* Build a super-powered ctrl+f that finds the answer to questions like 'Who is the CTO?', rather than just all the occurrences of a keyword;
* Build an expressive query tool for textual data - extract features with a single question;
* Build a virtual office assistant that answers routine questions through Slack; and
* Build an add-on to your private search that mimics Google's 'direct answers'.

You can communicate with Cape either directly over HTTP or using our Python client library. To install the Python client simply run:

``pip3 install cape-client``
